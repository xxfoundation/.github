# xx foundation

Our goal is to support the development of a privacy-oriented Web3 community using the xx network. The xx network is backed by a community of privacy-conscious, talented and passionate individuals from around the world. The xx Foundation supports the network through physical and virtual events, competitions, meetups, hackathons, and partnerships.

This organization holds archives of all the xx network software resources and websites. Our development is primarily done via our private gitlab instance here:
